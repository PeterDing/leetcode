-----------

<p>Given an array <code>nums</code> of <em>n</em> integers and an integer <code>target</code>, find three integers in <code>nums</code>&nbsp;such that the sum is closest to&nbsp;<code>target</code>. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 1.

The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
</pre>
