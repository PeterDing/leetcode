## Thought:

- Merge one by one

We merge these list one by one.

Namely, we firstly merge K_i and K_i+1 as K_i+1, then recursively.

We notice the O is max(len(K_i), len(K_i+1)) after merging two list.

So, the O is sum(len(K_i)) after merging k lists.

- Improve merging one by one

We merge the k lists using diving and conquer.

(K_1, K_2) merged as K_2, (K_3, K_4) as K_4, â€¦.

Then, (K_2, K_4) merge.

O(sum(len(K_i)) * logK)
