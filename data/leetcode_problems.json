To write correct code, think about the [invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_\\(computer_science\\)) to maintain. What is it?\n  5. The invariant is `x` and `y` must always point to a valid point in the 2d vector. Should you maintain your invariant _ahead of time_ or _right when you need it_?\n  6. Not sure? Think about how you would implement `hasNext()`. Which is more complex?\n  7. Common logic in two different places should be refactored into a common method.\nFollow up:\nAs an added challenge, try to code it using only [iterators in\nC++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/iterator/iterator/) or [iterators in\nJava](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html).",

You need to find the minimum number of steps in order to spell all the characters in the keyword.\r\n\r\nInitially, the first character of the ring is aligned at 12:00 direction. You need to spell all the characters in the string key one by one by rotating the ring clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at 12:00 direction and then by pressing the center button.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character key[i]:\r\n\r\nYou can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise one place, which counts as 1 step.

But all work and no play makes Jack a\ndull boy, you could take vacations in some particular cities and weeks. Your\njob is to schedule the traveling to maximize the number of vacation days you\ncould take, but there are certain rules and restrictions you need to follow.\nRules and restrictions:\n  1. You can only travel among N cities, represented by indexes from 0 to N-1. Initially, you are in the city indexed 0 on Monday.\n  2. The cities are connected by flights. The flights are represented as a N*N matrix (not necessary symmetrical), called flights representing the airline status from the city i to the city j. If there is no flight from the city i to the city j, flights[i][j] = 0; Otherwise, flights[i][j] = 1. Also, flights[i][i] = 0 for all i.\n  3. You totally have K weeks (each week has 7 days) to travel. You can only take flights at most once per day and can only take flights on each week's Monday morning. Since flight time is so short, we don't consider the impact of flight time.\n  4. For each city, you can only have restricted vacation days in different weeks, given an N*K matrix called days representing this relationship. For the value of days[i][j], it represents the maximum days you could take vacation in the city i in the week j.\nYou're given the flights matrix and days matrix, and you need to output the\nmaximum vacation days you could take during K weeks.\nExample 1:\n    Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[1,3,1],[6,0,3],[3,3,3]]Output: 12Explanation:\n    Ans = 6 + 3 + 3 = 12.\n    One of the best strategies is:1st week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 6 days and work 1 day.\n    (Although you start at city 0, we could also fly to and start at other cities since it is Monday.) 2nd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 3 days and work 4 days.3rd week : stay at city 2, and play 3 days and work 4 days.\nExample 2:\n    Input:flights = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], days = [[1,1,1],[7,7,7],[7,7,7]]Output: 3Explanation:\n    Ans = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.\n    Since there is no flights enable you to move to another city, you have to stay at city 0 for the whole 3 weeks.\n    For each week, you only have one day to play and six days to work.\n    So the maximum number of vacation days is 3.\nExample 3:\n    Input:flights = [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,0]], days = [[7,0,0],[0,7,0],[0,0,7]]Output: 21Explanation:\n    Ans = 7 + 7 + 7 = 21\n    One of the best strategies is:1st week : stay at city 0, and play 7 days. 2nd week : fly from city 0 to city 1 on Monday, and play 7 days.3rd week : fly from city 1 to city 2 on Monday, and play 7 days.\nNote:\n  1. N and K are positive integers, which are in the range of [1, 100].\n  2. In the matrix flights, all the values are integers in the range of [0, 1].\n  3. In the matrix days, all the values are integers in the range [0, 7].\n  4. You could stay at a city beyond the number of vacation days, but you should work on the extra days, which won't be counted as vacation days.\n  5. If you fly from the city A to the city B and take the vacation on that day, the deduction towards vacation days will count towards the vacation days of city B in that week.\n  6.

        "description": "Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid. A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\r\n\r\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\r\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\r\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\r\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\r\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\r\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME  (not necessarily valid).\r\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>. \r\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters. \r\n\r\n\r\nValid Code Examples:\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\r\nOutput: True\r\nExplanation: \r\nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \r\nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \r\nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as tag.\r\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\r\nOutput: True\r\nExplanation:\r\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\r\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\r\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\r\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\r\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\r\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\r\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\r\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvalid Code Examples:\r\n\r\nInput: \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa.\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV>  div tag is not closed  <DIV>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched <  </DIV>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV> closed tags with invalid tag name  <b>123</b> </DIV>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV> unmatched tags with invalid tag name  </1234567890> and <CDATA[[]]>  </DIV>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\n\r\nInput: \"<DIV>  unmatched start tag <B>  and unmatched end tag </C>  </DIV>\"\r\nOutput: False\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, you could assume the input code (including the any characters mentioned above) only contain letters, digits, '<','>','/','!','[',']' and ' '.",
