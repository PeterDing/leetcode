```
Given an array of _n_ integers _nums_ and a _target_ , find the number of
index triplets `i, j, k` with `0 <= i < j < k < n` that satisfy the condition
`nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target`. For example, given _nums_ = `[-2, 0,
1, 3]`, and _target_ = 2. Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums
are less than 2: [-2, 0, 1] [-2, 0, 3] Follow up: Could you solve it in _O_ (
_n_ 2) runtime?```
