```
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces  . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

Some examples:

"3+2*2" = 7
" 3/2 " = 1
" 3+5 / 2 " = 5




Note: Do not use the eval built-in library function.
