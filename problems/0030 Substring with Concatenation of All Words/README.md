```
You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening characters.



For example, given:
s: "barfoothefoobarman"
words: ["foo", "bar"]



You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).
