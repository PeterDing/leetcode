```
Given a balanced parentheses string S, compute the score of the string based on the following rule:


	() has score 1
	AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
	(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.


 


Example 1:


Input: "()"
Output: 1



Example 2:


Input: "(())"
Output: 2



Example 3:


Input: "()()"
Output: 2



Example 4:


Input: "(()(()))"
Output: 6


 

Note:


	S is a balanced parentheses string, containing only ( and ).
	2 <= S.length <= 50
