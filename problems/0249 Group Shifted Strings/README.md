```
Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter,
for example: `"abc" -> "bcd"`. We can keep "shifting" which forms the
sequence:



    "abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"

Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all
strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.

For example, given: `["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"]`,
Return:



    [  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],  ["az","ba"],  ["acef"],  ["a","z"]]



Note: For the return value, each  _inner_  list's elements must follow the
lexicographic order.
