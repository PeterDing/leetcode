```
Given a list of strings, you could concatenate these strings together into a
loop, where for each string you could choose to reverse it or not. Among all
the possible loops, you need to find the lexicographically biggest string
after cutting the loop, which will make the looped string into a regular one.
Specifically, to find the lexicographically biggest string, you need to
experience two phases: 1\. Concatenate all the strings into a loop, where you
can reverse some strings or not and connect them in the same order as given.
2\. Cut and make one breakpoint in any place of the loop, which will make the
looped string into a regular one starting from the character at the cutpoint.
And your job is to find the lexicographically biggest one among all the
possible regular strings. Example: Input: "abc", "xyz" Output: "zyxcba"
Explanation: You can get the looped string "-abcxyz-", "-abczyx-", "-cbaxyz-",
"-cbazyx-", where '-' represents the looped status. The answer string came
from the fourth looped one, where you could cut from the middle character 'a'
and get "zyxcba". Note: 1\. The input strings will only contain lowercase
letters. 2\. The total length of all the strings will not over 1,000.```
