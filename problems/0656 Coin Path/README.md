```
Given an array `A` (index starts at `1`) consisting of N integers: A1, A2,
..., AN and an integer `B`. The integer `B`denotes that from any place
(suppose the index is `i`) in the array `A`, you can jump to any one of the
place in the array `A` indexed `i+1`, `i+2`, â€¦, `i+B` if this place can be
jumped to. Also, if you step on the index `i`, you have to pay Ai coins. If Ai
is -1, it means you can't jump to the place indexed `i` in the array.

Now, you start from the place indexed `1` in the array `A`, and your aim is to
reach the place indexed `N` using the minimum coins. You need to return the
path of indexes (starting from 1 to N) in the array you should take to get to
the place indexed `N` using minimum coins.

If there are multiple paths with the same cost, return the lexicographically
smallest such path.

If it's not possible to reach the place indexed N then you need to return an
empty array.

Example 1:



    Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 2Output: [1,3,5]



Example 2:



    Input: [1,2,4,-1,2], 1Output: []



Note:

  1. Path Pa1, Pa2, ..., Pan is lexicographically smaller than Pb1, Pb2, ..., Pbm, if and only if at the first `i` where Pai and Pbi differ, Pai < Pbi; when no such `i` exists, then `n` < `m`.
  2. A1 >= 0. A2, ..., AN (if exist) will in the range of [-1, 100].
  3. Length of A is in the range of [1, 1000].
  4. B is in the range of [1, 100].
