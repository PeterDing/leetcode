```
Given a set of keywords `words` and a string `S`, make all appearances of all
keywords in `S` bold. Any letters between `<b>` and `</b>` tags become bold.

The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of
course the tags should form a valid combination.

For example, given that `words = ["ab", "bc"]` and `S = "aabcd"`, we should
return `"a<b>abc</b>d"`. Note that returning `"a<b>a<b>b</b>c</b>d"` would use
more tags, so it is incorrect.

Note:

  1. `words` has length in range `[0, 50]`.
  2. `words[i]` has length in range `[1, 10]`.
  3. `S` has length in range `[0, 500]`.
  4. All characters in `words[i]` and `S` are lowercase letters.
