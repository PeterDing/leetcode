```
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string. The
expression string may contain open `(` and closing parentheses `)`, the plus
`+` or minus sign `-`, non-negative integers and empty spaces ``. The
expression string contains only non-negative integers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
operators , open `(` and closing parentheses `)` and empty spaces ``. The
integer division should truncate toward zero. You may assume that the given
expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of
`[-2147483648, 2147483647]`. Some examples: "1 + 1" = 2 " 6-4 / 2 " = 4
"2*(5+5*2)/3+(6/2+8)" = 21 "(2+6* 3+5- (3*14/7+2)*5)+3"=-12 Note: Do not use
the `eval` built-in library function.```
