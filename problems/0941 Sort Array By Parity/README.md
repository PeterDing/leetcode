```
Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, return an array consisting of all
the even elements of `A`, followed by all the odd elements of `A`.

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [3,1,2,4]
    **Output:** [2,4,3,1]
    The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
    



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 5000`
  2. `0 <= A[i] <= 5000`
```
