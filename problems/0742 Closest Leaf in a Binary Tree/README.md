```
Given a binary tree where every node has a unique value, and a target key `k`,
find the value of the nearest leaf node to target `k` in the tree.

Here,  _nearest_  to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the
binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree. Also, a node is called a  _leaf_
if it has no children.

In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row
by row. The actual `root` tree given will be a TreeNode object.

Example 1:



    Input:root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1Diagram of binary tree:          1         / \        3   2Output: 2 (or 3)Explanation: Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.



Example 2:



    Input:root = [1], k = 1Output: 1Explanation: The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.



Example 3:



    Input:root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2Diagram of binary tree:             1            / \           2   3          /         4        /       5      /     6Output: 3Explanation: The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.



Note:

  1. `root` represents a binary tree with at least `1` node and at most `1000` nodes.
  2. Every node has a unique `node.val` in range `[1, 1000]`.
  3. There exists some node in the given binary tree for which `node.val == k`.
