```
Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str` follows the same pattern.

Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
letter in `pattern` and a non-empty substring in `str`.

Examples:

  1. pattern = `"abab"`, str = `"redblueredblue"` should return true.
  2. pattern = `"aaaa"`, str = `"asdasdasdasd"` should return true.
  3. pattern = `"aabb"`, str = `"xyzabcxzyabc"` should return false.



Notes:
You may assume both `pattern` and `str` contains only lowercase letters.
