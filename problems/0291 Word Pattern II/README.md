-----------

```
Given a `pattern` and a string `str`, find if `str`follows the same pattern.
Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
letter in `pattern` and a non-empty substring in `str`. Example 1: Input:
pattern = "abab", str = "redblueredblue" Output: true Example 2: Input:
pattern = pattern = "aaaa", str = "asdasdasdasd" Output: true Example 3:
Input: pattern = "aabb", str = "xyzabcxzyabc" Output: false Notes: You may
assume both `pattern` and `str` contains only lowercase letters.```
