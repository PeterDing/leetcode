-----------

```
Given a string `s`, return all the palindromic permutations (without
duplicates) of it. Return an empty list if no palindromic permutation could be
form.

For example:

Given `s = "aabb"`, return `["abba", "baab"]`.

Given `s = "abc"`, return `[]`.

Hint:

  1. If a palindromic permutation exists, we just need to generate the first half of the string.
  2. To generate all distinct permutations of a (half of) string, use a similar approach from: [Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii) or [Next Permutation](https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation).
