```
You are given the number of rows `n_rows` and number of columns `n_cols` of a
2D binary matrix where all values are initially 0. Write a function `flip`
which chooses a 0 value [uniformly at
random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution), changes
it to 1, and then returns the position `[row.id, col.id]` of that value. Also,
write a function `reset` which sets all values back to 0.  **Try to minimize
the number of calls to system 's Math.random()** and optimize the time and
space complexity.

Note:

  1. `1 <= n_rows, n_cols <= 10000`
  2. `0 <= row.id < n_rows` and `0 <= col.id < n_cols`
  3. `flip` will not be called when the matrix has no 0 values left.
  4. the total number of calls to `flip` and `reset` will not exceed 1000.

**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** ["Solution","flip","flip","flip","flip"]
    [[2,3],[],[],[],[]]
    **Output:** [null,[0,1],[1,2],[1,0],[1,1]]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** ["Solution","flip","flip","reset","flip"]
    [[1,2],[],[],[],[]]
    **Output:** [null,[0,0],[0,1],null,[0,0]]

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments.
`Solution`'s constructor has two arguments, `n_rows` and `n_cols`. `flip` and
`reset` have no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if
there aren't any.
