```
(This problem is the same as _Minimize Malware Spread_ , with the differences
bolded.)

In a network of nodes, each node `i` is directly connected to another node `j`
if and only if `graph[i][j] = 1`.

Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes
are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by
malware, both nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will
continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the
entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list, **completely removing it and
any connections from this node to any other node**.   Return the node that if
removed, would minimize `M(initial)`.  If multiple nodes could be removed to
minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]
    **Output:** 0
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]
    **Output:** 1
    

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** graph = [[1,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,1,1],[0,0,1,1]], initial = [0,1]
    **Output:** 1
    



**Note:**

  1. `1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300`
  2. `0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1`
  3. `graph[i][i] = 1`
  4. `1 <= initial.length < graph.length`
  5. `0 <= initial[i] < graph.length`
```
