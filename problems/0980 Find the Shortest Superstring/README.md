```
Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each
string in `A` as a substring.

We may assume that no string in `A` is substring of another string in `A`.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
    **Output:** "alexlovesleetcode"
    **Explanation:** All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
    **Output:** "gctaagttcatgcatc"



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
  2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
```
