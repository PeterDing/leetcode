-----------

```
On a horizontal number line, we have gas stations at positions `stations[0],
stations[1], ..., stations[N-1]`, where `N = stations.length`. Now, we add `K`
more gas stations so that D, the maximum distance between adjacent gas
stations, is minimized. Return the smallest possible value of D. Example:
Input: stations = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], K = 9 Output: 0.500000
Note: 1\. `stations.length` will be an integer in range `[10, 2000]`. 2\.
`stations[i]` will be an integer in range `[0, 10^8]`. 3\. `K` will be an
integer in range `[1, 10^6]`. 4\. Answers within `10^-6` of the true value
will be accepted as correct.```
