```
You need to construct a binary tree from a string consisting of parenthesis
and integers. The whole input represents a binary tree. It contains an integer
followed by zero, one or two pairs of parenthesis. The integer represents the
root's value and a pair of parenthesis contains a child binary tree with the
same structure. You always start to construct the left child node of the
parent first if it exists. Example: Input: "4(2(3)(1))(6(5))" Output: return
the tree root node representing the following tree: 4 / \ 2 6 / \ / 3 1 5
Note: 1\. There will only be `'('`, `')'`, `'-'` and `'0'` ~ `'9'` in the
input string. 2\. An empty tree is represented by `""` instead of `"()"`.```
