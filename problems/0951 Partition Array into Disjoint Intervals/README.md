```
Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and
`right` so that:

  * Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
  * `left` and `right` are non-empty.
  * `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning.  It is guaranteed
that such a partitioning exists.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** [5,0,3,8,6]
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** [1,1,1,0,6,12]
    **Output:** 4
    **Explanation:** left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
    



**Note:**

  1. `2 <= A.length <= 30000`
  2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
  3. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.
