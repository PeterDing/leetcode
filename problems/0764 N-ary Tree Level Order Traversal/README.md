-----------

```
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

For example, given a 3-ary tree:
 


 

We should return its level order traversal:

 

 


[
     [1],
     [3,2,4],
     [5,6]
]


 

Note:


	The depth of the tree is at most 1000.
	The total number of nodes is at most 5000.


 
```
