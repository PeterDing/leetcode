```
Design a Phone Directory which supports the following operations:
  1. `get`: Provide a number which is not assigned to anyone.
  2. `check`: Check if a number is available or not.
  3. `release`: Recycle or release a number.
**Example:**
    // Init a phone directory containing a total of 3 numbers: 0, 1, and 2.
PhoneDirectory directory = new PhoneDirectory(3);
// It can return any available phone number. Here we assume it returns 0.
directory.get();
// Assume it returns 1.
directory.get();
// The number 2 is available, so return true.
directory.check(2);
// It returns 2, the only number that is left.
directory.get();
// The number 2 is no longer available, so return false.
directory.check(2);
// Release number 2 back to the pool.
directory.release(2);
// Number 2 is available again, return true.
directory.check(2);
```
