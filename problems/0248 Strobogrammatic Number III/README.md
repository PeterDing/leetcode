```
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180
degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the
range of low <= num <= high.

Example:



    Input: low = "50", high = "100"Output: 3 Explanation: 69, 88, and 96 are three strobogrammatic numbers.

Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the  _low_ and  _high_  numbers are
represented as string.
