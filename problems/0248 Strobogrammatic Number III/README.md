```
A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180
degrees (looked at upside down).

Write a function to count the total strobogrammatic numbers that exist in the
range of low <= num <= high.

For example,
Given low = "50", high = "100", return 3. Because 69, 88, and 96 are three
strobogrammatic numbers.

Note:
Because the range might be a large number, the _low_ and _high_ numbers are
represented as string.
