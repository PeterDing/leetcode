```
Given a set of keywords `words` and a string `S`, make all appearances of all
keywords in `S` bold. Any letters between ` **` and `** ` tags become bold.
The returned string should use the least number of tags possible, and of
course the tags should form a valid combination. For example, given that
`words = ["ab", "bc"]` and `S = "aabcd"`, we should return `"a **abc** d"`.
Note that returning `"a **a **b** c**d"` would use more tags, so it is
incorrect. Note: 1\. `words` has length in range `[0, 50]`. 2\. `words[i]` has
length in range `[1, 10]`. 3\. `S` has length in range `[0, 500]`. 4\. All
characters in `words[i]` and `S` are lowercase letters.```
