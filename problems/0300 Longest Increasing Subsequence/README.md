-----------

<p>Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> <code>[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
</code><b>Output: </b>4 
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The longest increasing subsequence is <code>[2,3,7,101]</code>, therefore the length is <code>4</code>. </pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.</li>
	<li>Your algorithm should run in O(<i>n<sup>2</sup></i>) complexity.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Follow up:</b> Could you improve it to O(<i>n</i> log <i>n</i>) time complexity?</p>
