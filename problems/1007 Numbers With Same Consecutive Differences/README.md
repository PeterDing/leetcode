```
Return all **non-negative** integers of length `N` such that the absolute
difference between every two consecutive digits is `K`.

Note that **every** number in the answer **must not** have leading zeros
**except** for the number `0` itself. For example, `01` has one leading zero
and is invalid, but `0` is valid.

You may return the answer in any order.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** N = 3, K = 7
    **Output:** [181,292,707,818,929]
    **Explanation:** Note that 070 is not a valid number, because it has leading zeroes.
    

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** N = 2, K = 1
    **Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]



**Note:**

  1. `1 <= N <= 9`
  2. `0 <= K <= 9`
```
