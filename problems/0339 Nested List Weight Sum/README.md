-----------

```
Given a nested list of integers, return the sum of all integers in the list
weighted by their depth.
Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be
integers or other lists.
**Example 1:**
Given the list `[[1,1],2,[1,1]]`, return **10**. (four 1's at depth 2, one 2
at depth 1)
**Example 2:**
Given the list `[1,[4,[6]]]`, return **27**. (one 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth
2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27)
```
