```
Given a start IP address `ip` and a number of ips we need to cover `n`, return
a representation of the range as a list (of smallest possible length) of CIDR
blocks.

A CIDR block is a string consisting of an IP, followed by a slash, and then
the prefix length. For example: "123.45.67.89/20". That prefix length "20"
represents the number of common prefix bits in the specified range.

**Example 1:**


    **Input:** ip = "255.0.0.7", n = 10**Output:** ["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/29","255.0.0.16/32"]**Explanation:**The initial ip address, when converted to binary, looks like this (spaces added for clarity):255.0.0.7 - > 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000111The address "255.0.0.7/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,ie. just this one address.The address "255.0.0.8/29" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 29 bits to the given address:255.0.0.8 -> 11111111 00000000 00000000 00001000Addresses with common prefix of 29 bits are:11111111 00000000 00000000 0000100011111111 00000000 00000000 0000100111111111 00000000 00000000 0000101011111111 00000000 00000000 0000101111111111 00000000 00000000 0000110011111111 00000000 00000000 0000110111111111 00000000 00000000 0000111011111111 00000000 00000000 00001111The address "255.0.0.16/32" specifies all addresses with a common prefix of 32 bits to the given address,ie. just 11111111 00000000 00000000 00010000.In total, the answer specifies the range of 10 ips starting with the address 255.0.0.7 .There were other representations, such as:["255.0.0.7/32","255.0.0.8/30", "255.0.0.12/30", "255.0.0.16/32"],but our answer was the shortest possible.Also note that a representation beginning with say, "255.0.0.7/30" would be incorrect,because it includes addresses like 255.0.0.4 = 11111111 00000000 00000000 00000100 that are outside the specified range.

**Note:**
    1. `ip` will be a valid IPv4 address.
    2. Every implied address `ip + x` (for `x < n`) will be a valid IPv4 address.
    3. `n` will be an integer in the range `[1, 1000]`.
