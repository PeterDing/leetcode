```
This is a follow up of [Shortest Word
Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance). The only
difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be
called _repeatedly_ many times with different parameters. How would you
optimize it? Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor,
and implements a method that takes two words _word1_ and _word2_ and return
the shortest distance between these two words in the list. For example, Assume
that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`. Given
_word1_ = `"coding"`, _word2_ = `"practice"`, return 3. Given _word1_ =
`"makes"`, _word2_ = `"coding"`, return 1. Note: You may assume that _word1_
does not equal to _word2_ , and _word1_ and _word2_ are both in the list.```
