```
Given a 2D matrix _matrix_ , find the sum of the elements inside the rectangle
defined by its upper left corner ( _row_ 1, _col_ 1) and lower right corner (
_row_ 2, _col_ 2). ![Range Sum Query
2D](https://leetcode.com/static/images/courses/range_sum_query_2d.png) The
above rectangle (with the red border) is defined by (row1, col1) = **(2, 1)**
and (row2, col2) = **(4, 3)** , which contains sum = **8**. **Example:** Given
matrix = [ [3, 0, 1, 4, 2], [5, 6, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 0, 1, 5], [4, 1, 0, 1, 7],
[1, 0, 3, 0, 5] ] sumRegion(2, 1, 4, 3) -> 8 update(3, 2, 2) sumRegion(2, 1,
4, 3) -> 10 **Note:** 1\. The matrix is only modifiable by the _update_
function. 2\. You may assume the number of calls to _update_ and _sumRegion_
function is distributed evenly. 3\. You may assume that _row_ 1 ≤ _row_ 2 and
_col_ 1 ≤ _col_ 2.```
