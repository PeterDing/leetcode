-----------

<p>Given a data stream input of non-negative integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, ..., summarize the numbers seen so far as a list of disjoint intervals.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the integers from the data stream are 1, 3, 7, 2, 6, ..., then the summary will be:</p>

<pre>
[1, 1]
[1, 1], [3, 3]
[1, 1], [3, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [7, 7]
[1, 3], [6, 7]
</pre>

<p><b>Follow up:</b><br />
What if there are lots of merges and the number of disjoint intervals are small compared to the data stream&#39;s size?</p>
