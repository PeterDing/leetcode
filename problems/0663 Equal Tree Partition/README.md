```
Given a binary tree with `n` nodes, your task is to check if it's possible to
partition the tree to two trees which have the equal sum of values after
removing exactly one edge on the original tree.

Example 1:



    Input:         5   / \  10 10    /  \   2   3Output: TrueExplanation:     5   /   10      Sum: 15   10  /  \ 2    3Sum: 15



Example 2:



    Input:         1   / \  2  10    /  \   2   20Output: FalseExplanation: You can't split the tree into two trees with equal sum after removing exactly one edge on the tree.
