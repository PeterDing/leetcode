```
Given an unsorted array nums, reorder it such that
    nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]....



    Example:
    (1) Given nums = [1, 5, 1, 1, 6, 4], one possible answer is [1, 4, 1, 5, 1, 6]. 
    (2) Given nums = [1, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1], one possible answer is [2, 3, 1, 3, 1, 2].



    Note:
    You may assume all input has valid answer.



    Follow Up:
    Can you do it in O(n) time and/or in-place with O(1) extra space?
