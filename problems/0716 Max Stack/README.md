```
Design a max stack that supports push, pop, top, peekMax and popMax. 1\.
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack. 2\. pop() -- Remove the element on top
of the stack and return it. 3\. top() -- Get the element on the top. 4\.
peekMax() -- Retrieve the maximum element in the stack. 5\. popMax() --
Retrieve the maximum element in the stack, and remove it. If you find more
than one maximum elements, only remove the top-most one. Example 1: MaxStack
stack = new MaxStack(); stack.push(5); stack.push(1); stack.push(5);
stack.top(); -> 5 stack.popMax(); -> 5 stack.top(); -> 1 stack.peekMax(); -> 5
stack.pop(); -> 1 stack.top(); -> 5 Note: 1\. -1e7 <= x <= 1e7 2\. Number of
operations won't exceed 10000. 3\. The last four operations won't be called
when stack is empty.```
