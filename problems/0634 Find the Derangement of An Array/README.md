```
In combinatorial mathematics, a derangement is a permutation of the elements
of a set, such that no element appears in its original position.

There's originally an array consisting of `n` integers from 1 to `n` in
ascending order, you need to find the number of derangement it can generate.

Also, since the answer may be very large, you should return the output mod 109
\+ 7.

Example 1:



    Input: 3Output: 2Explanation: The original array is [1,2,3]. The two derangements are [2,3,1] and [3,1,2].



Note:
`n` is in the range of [1, 106].
