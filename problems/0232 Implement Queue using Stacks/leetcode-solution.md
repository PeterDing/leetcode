<p>Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.</p>

<ul>
	<li>push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.</li>
	<li>pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.</li>
	<li>peek() -- Get the front element.</li>
	<li>empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();

queue.push(1);
queue.push(2);  
queue.peek();  // returns 1
queue.pop();   // returns 1
queue.empty(); // returns false</pre>

<p><b>Notes:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>You must use <i>only</i> standard operations of a stack -- which means only <code>push to top</code>, <code>peek/pop from top</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>is empty</code> operations are valid.</li>
	<li>Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only standard operations of a stack.</li>
	<li>You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek operations will be called on an empty queue).</li>
</ul>

## Summary
This article is for beginners. It introduces the following ideas:
Queue, Stack.

## Solution

Queue is **FIFO** (first in - first out) data structure, in which the elements are inserted from one side - `rear` and removed from the other - `front`.
The most intuitive way to implement it is with linked lists, but this article will introduce another approach  using stacks.
Stack is **LIFO** (last in - first out) data structure, in which elements are added and removed from the same end, called `top`.
To satisfy **FIFO** property of a queue we need to keep two stacks. They serve to reverse arrival order of the  elements and one of them store the queue elements in their final order.

#### Approach #1 (Two Stacks) Push - $$O(n)$$ per operation, Pop - $$O(1)$$ per operation.

**Algorithm**

**Push**

A queue is FIFO (first-in-first-out) but a stack is LIFO (last-in-first-out). This means the newest element must be pushed to the bottom of the stack. To do so we first transfer all `s1` elements to auxiliary stack `s2`. Then the newly arrived element is pushed on top of `s2` and all its elements are popped and pushed to `s1`.

**Java**

```java
private int front;

public void push(int x) {
    if (s1.empty())
        front = x;
    while (!s1.isEmpty())
        s2.push(s1.pop());
    s2.push(x);
    while (!s2.isEmpty())
        s1.push(s2.pop());
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(n)$$.

 Each element, with the exception of the newly arrived, is pushed and popped twice. The last inserted element is popped and pushed once. Therefore this gives  $$4 n + 2$$  operations where $$n$$ is the queue size. The  `push` and `pop` operations have $$O(1)$$ time complexity.

* Space complexity : $$O(n)$$.
We need additional memory to store the queue elements

**Pop**

The algorithm pops an element from  the stack `s1`, because `s1` stores always on its top the first inserted element in the queue.
The front element of the queue is kept as `front`.

**Java**

```java

// Removes the element from the front of queue.
public void pop() {
    s1.pop();
    if (!s1.empty())
        front = s1.peek();
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.
* Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.

**Empty**

Stack `s1` contains all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` size to return if the queue is empty.

```java
// Return whether the queue is empty.
public boolean empty() {
    return s1.isEmpty();
}
```

Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.

Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.

**Peek**

The `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push or pop an element.

```java
// Get the front element.
public int peek() {
  return front;
}
```

Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.
The `front` element has been calculated in advance and only returned in `peek` operation.

Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.

#### Approach #2 (Two Stacks) Push - $$O(1)$$ per operation, Pop - Amortized $$O(1)$$ per operation.

**Algorithm**

**Push**

The newly arrived element is always added on top of stack `s1` and the first element is kept as `front` queue element

// Push element x to the back of queue.
public void push(int x) {
    if (s1.empty())
        front = x;
    s1.push(x);
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.

 –êppending an element to a stack is an O(1) operation.

* Space complexity : $$O(n)$$.
We need additional memory to store the queue elements

**Pop**

We have to remove element in front of the queue. This is the first inserted element in the stack `s1` and it is positioned at the bottom of the stack because of stack's `LIFO (last in - first out)` policy. To remove the bottom element  from  `s1`, we have to pop all elements from `s1` and to push them on to an additional stack `s2`, which helps us to store the elements of `s1` in reversed order. This way  the bottom element of `s1` will be positioned on top of `s2` and we can simply pop it from stack `s2`. Once `s2` is empty, the algorithm transfer data from `s1` to `s2` again.

{:align="center"}

**Java**

```java
// Removes the element from in front of queue.
public void pop() {
    if (s2.isEmpty()) {
        while (!s1.isEmpty())
            s2.push(s1.pop());
    }
    s2.pop();    
}
```

**Complexity Analysis**

* Time complexity: Amortized $$O(1)$$, Worst-case $$O(n)$$.

In the worst case scenario when stack `s2` is empty, the algorithm pops $$n$$ elements from stack s1 and pushes $$n$$ elements to `s2`, where $$n$$ is the queue size. This gives $$2n$$ operations, which is $$O(n)$$. But when stack `s2` is not empty the algorithm has $$O(1)$$ time complexity. So what does it mean by Amortized $$O(1)$$? Please see the next section on Amortized Analysis for more information.

* Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.

**Amortized Analysis**

Amortized analysis gives the average performance (over time) of each operation in the worst case. The basic idea is that a worst case operation can alter the state in such a way that the worst case cannot occur again for a long time, thus amortizing its cost.

Consider this example where we start with an empty queue with the following sequence of operations applied:

$$
push_1, push_2, \ldots, push_n, pop_1,pop_2 \ldots, pop_n
$$

The worst case time complexity of a single pop operation is $$O(n)$$. Since we have $$n$$ pop operations, using the worst-case per operation analysis gives us a total of $$O(n^2)$$ time.

However, in a sequence of operations the worst case does not occur often in each operation - some operations may be cheap, some may be expensive. Therefore, a traditional worst-case per operation analysis can give overly pessimistic bound. For example, in a dynamic array only some inserts take a linear time, though others - a constant time.

In the example above, the number of times pop operation can be called is limited by the number of push operations before it. Although a single pop operation could be expensive, it is expensive only once per `n` times (queue size), when `s2` is empty and there is a need for data transfer between `s1` and `s2`. Hence the total time complexity of the sequence is : `n` (for push operations) + `2*n` (for first pop operation) + `n - 1` ( for pop operations) which is $$O(2*n)$$.This gives $$O(2n/2n)$$ = $$O(1)$$ average time per operation.

**Empty**

Both stacks `s1` and `s2` contain all stack elements, so the algorithm checks `s1` and `s2` size to return if the queue is empty.

```java

// Return whether the queue is empty.
public boolean empty() {
    return s1.isEmpty() && s2.isEmpty();
}
```

Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.

Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.


**Peek**

The `front` element is kept in constant memory and is modified when we push an element. When `s2` is not empty, front element is positioned on the top of `s2`

```java
// Get the front element.
public int peek() {
    if (!s2.isEmpty()) {
            return s2.peek();
    }
    return front;
}
```

Time complexity : $$O(1)$$.

The `front` element was either previously calculated or returned as a top element of stack `s2`. Therefore complexity is $$O(1)$$

Space complexity : $$O(1)$$.
