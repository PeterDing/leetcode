```
In a binary tree, the root node is at depth `0`, and children of each depth
`k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are _cousins_ if they have the same depth, but have
**different parents**.

We are given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values, and the values
`x` and `y` of two different nodes in the tree.

Return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y`
are cousins.



**Example 1:

    **Input:** root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
    **Output:** false
    

**Example 2:  
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-02.png)**

    
    
    **Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
    **Output:** true
    

**Example 3:**

    **Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
    **Output:** false



**Note:**

  1. The number of nodes in the tree will be between `2` and `100`.
  2. Each node has a unique integer value from `1` to `100`.
