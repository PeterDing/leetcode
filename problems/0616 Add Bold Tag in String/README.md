```
Given a string s and a list of strings dict, you need to add a closed pair of
bold tag ` **` and `** ` to wrap the substrings in s that exist in dict. If
two such substrings overlap, you need to wrap them together by only one pair
of closed bold tag. Also, if two substrings wrapped by bold tags are
consecutive, you need to combine them. Example 1: Input: s = "abcxyz123" dict
= ["abc","123"] Output: " **abc** xyz **123** " Example 2: Input: s =
"aaabbcc" dict = ["aaa","aab","bc"] Output: " **aaabbc** c" Note: 1\. The
given dict won't contain duplicates, and its length won't exceed 100. 2\. All
the strings in input have length in range [1, 1000].```
