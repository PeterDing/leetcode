```
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of
that node in the BST.
The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than
`p.val`.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_1.PNG)
    Input: root = [2,1,3], p = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/01/23/285_example_2.PNG)
    Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6
Output: null
Explanation: There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.
Note:
  1. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.
  2. It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.
