```
Given a sorted array of integers  _nums_  and integer values  _a_ ,  _b_ and
_c_. Apply a quadratic function of the form f( _x_ ) =  _ax_ 2 +  _bx_  +  _c_
to each element  _x_  in the array.

The returned array must be in sorted order.

Expected time complexity: O( _n_ )

Example 1:



    Input: nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = 1, b = 3, c = 5Output: [3,9,15,33]

Example 2:



    Input: nums = [-4,-2,2,4], a = -1, b = 3, c = 5Output: [-23,-5,1,7]
