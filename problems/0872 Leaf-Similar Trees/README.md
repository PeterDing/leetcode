-----------

<p>Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.&nbsp; From&nbsp;left to right order, the values of those&nbsp;leaves form a <em>leaf value sequence.</em></p>

<p>For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is <code>(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)</code>.</p>

<p>Two binary trees are considered <em>leaf-similar</em>&nbsp;if their leaf value sequence is the same.</p>

<p>Return <code>true</code> if and only if the two given trees with head nodes <code>root1</code> and <code>root2</code> are leaf-similar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Both of the given trees will have between <code>1</code> and <code>100</code> nodes.</li>
</ul>
