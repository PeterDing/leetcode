```
Given a positive integer `K`, you need find the **smallest**  positive integer
`N` such that `N` is divisible by `K`, and `N` only contains the digit **1**.

Return the length of `N`.  If there is no such `N`, return -1.



**Example 1:**

    
    
    **Input:** 1
    **Output:** 1
    **Explanation:** The smallest answer is N = 1, which has length 1.

**Example 2:**

    
    
    **Input:** 2
    **Output:** -1
    **Explanation:** There is no such positive integer N divisible by 2.

**Example 3:**

    
    
    **Input:** 3
    **Output:** 3
    **Explanation:** The smallest answer is N = 111, which has length 3.



**Note:**

  * `1 <= K <= 10^5`
```
