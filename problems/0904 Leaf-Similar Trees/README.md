```
Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the
values of those leaves form a _leaf value sequence._

![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)

For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9,
8)`.

Two binary trees are considered _leaf-similar_  if their leaf value sequence
is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and
`root2` are leaf-similar.



**Note:**

  * Both of the given trees will have between `1` and `100` nodes.
