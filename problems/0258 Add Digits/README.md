```
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit. 



For example:


Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2. Since 2 has only one digit, return it.


Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
